# sproutline

A library for sprite outline extraction and simplification.

Input: Sprite with an alpha channel.

Output: All the outline paths (simplified, if necessary) for objects in the sprite image.


'sproutline.h' is the whole library.

It follows the stb philosophy.

Everything else here is example usage.
